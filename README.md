conditional rendering in react :

conditional rendering is refers to what we need to show in the UI, based on the condition we will display UI


conditional rendering classified into 3 ways

1. if/else
2. ternary operator - condition ? expression 1 :expression 2
3. logical operator (short circuit operator) && (handles only the true case)


exports :
General we use 2 ways to export the functions/ components / variables

1. Default exports (one component in a file,we can export default)
while importing the default exports we dont require curly braces 

2. Named exports -we can have asa many exports in a file
while importing the named exports we  require curly braces 


A file can consists of as many exports out of those, we can only export default one time
